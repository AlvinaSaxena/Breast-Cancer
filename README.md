This model aid in the detection and diagnosis of breast cancer using Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset. It uses Logistic Regression Classification and gives an accuracy of 96.70%. The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust machine learning (ML) model capable of accurately predicting the presence of breast cancer based on a variety of medical data inputs. The model aims to assist healthcare professionals by providing reliable, interpretable, and timely predictions that can improve the early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer.
